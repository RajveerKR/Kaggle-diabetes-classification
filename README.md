# Kaggle Diabetes Classification (Playground Series S5E12)

## Overview
This project builds and evaluates machine learning models to predict the probability of diabetes using the Kaggle Playground Series S5E12 dataset.

**Note:** This is a competition / learning dataset and the work is for educational purposes only. It is not intended for clinical use or medical decision-making.

## Goals
- Build a clean, reproducible ML workflow (EDA → preprocessing → training → evaluation → submission)
- Compare a strong baseline vs an improved model
- Document assumptions, limitations, and ethical considerations
