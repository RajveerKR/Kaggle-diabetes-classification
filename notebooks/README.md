# 📓 Notebooks

This folder links to the Kaggle notebooks used for model development and competition submission.

Due to dataset size constraints, notebooks are hosted directly on Kaggle.

## 📝 Notes
- The notebook focuses on **model clarity and interpretability**
- Outputs are later transformed into **risk bands** for dashboard analysis
- This approach mirrors real-world analytics workflows where model outputs inform decision-making
